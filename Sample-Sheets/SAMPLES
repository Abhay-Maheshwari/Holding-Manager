This folder contains dummy shareholding statement files in Excel format, generated to simulate real-world input for the Holdings Manager app.

Each file mimics the original structure of client shareholding statements, including columns like:
- ISIN Code
- Company Name
- Free (Number of shares held)
- Additional columns (Pledge, Remat, Demat, etc.) to maintain format fidelity

Note:
Owner names are intentionally extracted from the file name (e.g., between "Client" and "Client-ID").
All data is fictional and generated for demonstration purposes only.
You can upload 5â€“10 of these files at once in the app to test pivot table generation and export functionality.
